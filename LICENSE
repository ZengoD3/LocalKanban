                            Preamble

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license  
designed to ensure cooperation with the community, particularly for  
software used on network servers.

Most software licenses are designed to take away your freedom  
to share and modify the software. In contrast, our General Public  
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and modify  
all versions of a programâ€”ensuring it remains free software for all users.

When we speak of free software, we refer to **freedom, not price**.  
This license ensures you have the right to distribute copies of free software  
(and charge for them if you wish), access the source code, modify the software,  
and use it in new free programs.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution,  
and modification follow.

- If a modified version is deployed publicly, its source code must be made available.  
- Anyone is free to run, copy, modify, and distribute the application.
